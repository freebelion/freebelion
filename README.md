# About Me
I am a programming instructor with a background in engineering and physics.
My special interest is in modeling physical and social phenomena,
with a strong side interest in business process modeling with Simio.

My most important work is a WPF-based class/control library
which will -hopefully- be used by students and researchers
to develop programs for computer-based psychology experiments.
This library is a part of my
<a href="https://github.com/freebelion/HurPsy">HurPsy</a>
project, which is hosted here, on GitHub.<br />
<b>HurPsy</b> will also include a WPF Windows application
which will help non-programmers to design psychology experiments
without writing code.

I have recently taken up web application development with Blazor.
I have been sharing my applications in my
<a href="https://github.com/freebelion/Blazor" class="inline">Blazor</a>
project, which is open to everyone.<br />
Its README file presents my explanations (in Turkish)
for learners who are taking their first steps.

I have also been producing projects which may help
those who are learning visual programming.<br />
Those who want to get started with visual programming
on WPF framework can take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/freebelion/BST206-2023" class="inline">BST206-2023</a>
project.
That one, too, explains the development steps in its README file (in Turkish).
