# About Me
I am a programming instructor with a background in engineering and physics.
My special interest is in modeling physical and social phenomena,
with a strong side interest in business process modeling with Simio.

My most important work is a WPF-based class/control library
which will -hopefully- be used by students and researchers
to develop computer-based psychology experiments.
This library is a part of my
<a href="https://github.com/freebelion/HurPsy">HurPsy</a>
project, which is hosted here, on GitHub.

HurPsy also will also include a WPF Windows application which will help
non-programmers to design psychology experiments.

I have recently taken up web application development with Angular
and front-end design with Bootstrap.
I am also helping my students develop their own projects
using these platforms and frameworks.
They will be presenting and explaining their projects
on their own github profiles.

In order to inspire them, I have prepared my own
<a href="https://github.com/freebelion/AngularTest">AngularTest</a> project.<br>
For the explanations of its steps (in Turkish), please
